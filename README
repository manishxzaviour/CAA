poblem statement :
"understand and visualize stess, strain and displacement using fea due to tensile forces"
resources:
<'design of element structure' use image 'model.png' from root>
<'comutational analysis software' ansys use 'logo.png'>
boundary conditions:
<the fixed node of element and the node at which force is acting>
<use the image 'staticfigure.png'>
<make a label as node B=node at which tencile force is acting; node A= fixed node >
Parameters:
<use the force vs time graph from the ansys output at ProjectFemALL>Project.html>
<use the table below/above it of force data max 20000 min 0>
< use the Material Data >Structural Steel table to make 'material properties'> 
Solution:
<use the images in the ansys output ProjectFemALL>Project.html>
<use format <figure:graph> and table below it ; do for all available stress and strain>
discussion:
<use the deformation figure 'directional deformation', graph and table in ansys o/p to form 'result'>
<use the images  'ReactionForce.png'/'.jpg'/'ReactionForces2.png' to form conclusion>
<"Conclusion :">
{
the applied tensile force caused internal resistive force.
the internal resistive force results in stress in the elements.
the stress causes strain and deformation of the element structure.
}
